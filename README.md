By injecting js scripts into the browser OpenAI ChatGPT page, ChatGPT on the web page is turned into an API that supports multiple simultaneous connections

**How to use**: [How to use?](wiki/how-to-use.md)


### Implementation idea.

Build a message forwarding server, and complete communication with the server by injecting scripts into the browser ChatGPT page. The message forwarding server allows multiple users to connect, and queries raised by the user are queued and processed in order and returned to the user.
